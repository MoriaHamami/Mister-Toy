## Authentication
different permissions for admin and user
The user collection includes one admin user, which has more permissions than the rest of the users.

## Security
Our frontend holds an http service that communicates remotely with our backend via AJAX, and provides an async (CRUDL) access to a collection kept on mongoDB.

Relevant routes are protected using a middleware, while passwords and personal information are not accessable and are encrypted.

## Real-time 
Using sockets, I managed to implement chat functionality. Each toy page includes a chat-room. The chats include the names of those who sent messages, and real-time updates on users who are typing messages. The chat history is saved on the database.

## Design
For this project I used CSS to begin with, and later converted the files to SCSS. I added variables, mixins, functions and much more thanks to the wide range of options available with SCSS. 
In addition, I made sure the app is responsive, and looks great on desktop, tablet and mobile.

## Showcase

### Dashboard 
This page has the following charts:
- Prices per toy type (Adult, Educational etc.)
- Inventory by type â€“ Chart showing the percentage of toys that are in stock by type.
These charts were created using the chartjs library.

### About page
This page shows a map with markers for each shop branch. When the user selects a branch button, the map is centered on that location. This feature was created with a React Google Map library.
